# Welch and asymtptotic Z test

[Shiny app to play with the simulations](https://zhitkovk.github.io/welch_ztest/)

Welch test is mentioned everywhere. If you have unequal variances â€” use it, even if you're unsure whether you have them, still better stick to Welch, it is more robust etc.

Z test is usually mentioned either in the context of proportions test for 'big' data or in theoretical context of known variance.

What if we decide to abandon the recomendations and use Z test when the variances are unequal? Is it unsafe to rely on asymptotics?

Short answer: is double check your own data with simulations.
